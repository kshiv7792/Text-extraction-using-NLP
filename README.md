# Text-extraction-using-NLP
The project enhanced a text classification model with TF-IDF and transformer-based keyword extraction (KeyBERT, BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT). The updated TF-IDF improved contextual understanding, and a Flask app was developed for deployment. The app effectively handled user inputs and displayed predictions, despite some configuration challenges.
